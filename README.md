**Important**

**I'm stopping development on Pass4Win, the main reason is that I find the usability on Windows less then a service like Lastpass or Dashlane. Feel free to fork**

Windows version of Pass (http://www.passwordstore.org/) in the sense that the store (password structure) is and should be exactly the same between the two programs.

Make sure you have GnuPG for windows installed (http://www.gpg4win.org/) and have at least one secret key.
The setup can be downloaded from https://github.com/mbos/Pass4Win/releases

I'm using GpgAPI (https://gpgapi.codeplex.com/) for interfacing with GnuPG. And LibGit2Sharp (https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp) for git integration.
